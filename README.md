This project is a web application that allows users to search for authors' names in an Excel file and retrieve information about the books written by those authors. The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a search input field with auto-suggestions and a search button. The backend is built with Flask, a Python web framework, which serves the frontend and handles search requests. The Excel file contains columns for authors' names, books written by those authors, the number of copies sold, and the number of returned copies. When a user enters an author's name in the search field and clicks the search button, the backend retrieves the relevant information from the Excel file and returns it to the frontend for display.
